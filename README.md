# Bias Field-Free Simulator : A Simulator of Double Quantum Experiments

## Poetry
- Install `uv` following the [documentation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
- `uv sync` to use the commited `uv.lock` file.

- `uv lock` when you want to install by first updating and rewriting the `uv.lock` file.

## General

- The simulations in this repository rely on QuTip for generating fundamental elements. However, some solvers ultimately depend solely on Numpy once the mathematical framework is established.

- This repository offers implementations of different solvers to perform bias field free simulations.
